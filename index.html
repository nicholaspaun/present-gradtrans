				<ul class="incremental">
					<li>Chemlogic is a logic program for balancing chemical equations and converting chemical formulas to and from chemical names, using a database of chemical element and polyatomic group information, a set of grammars, and a linear equation solver. Chemlogic can detect and provide guidance for resolving syntax and other errors and has a user-friendly Web interface.</li>

				<ul class="incremental">
					<li>The original version of Chemlogic was a simple program that I wrote to simplify my chemistry homework.</li>
					<li>Last year, I decided to explore Computer Science, by writing and studying various programs and algorithms in an Independent Directed Studies course.</li>
					<li>I decided to extend Chemlogic to balance chemical equations.</li>
					<li>The project developed far beyond my expectations. I ended up adding many new features, a user-friendly interface and new error-detection and explanation capabilities <i>(pictured)</i>.</li>

					<li>My project was nationally recognized at the CWSF. I recieved a Bronze Excellence Award.</li>
					<li>Going to the science fairs gave me the opportunity to present my project to scientific experts <i>(pictured)</i> and to learn how to write science papers and create conference posters.</li>

					<li>I decided to extend Chemlogic and re-enter it into this year's science fair.</li>
					<li>At the CWSF, I recieved very valuable advice about university programs in computer science-related fields from the judges, many of whom were university professors (from diverse nationalities, as well).</li>
					<li>I made connections with technical experts, other young scientists and interested members of the public. </li>

					<li>Even if I go to university outside of BC, I hope to return to live here.</li>
					<li><ul><li>This might be somewhat difficult &mdash; I might have a job there.</li></ul></li>
